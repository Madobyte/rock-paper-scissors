Uploaded a .png versions of the assets to make the program work on Google Chrome.

I added an animation module. I need to figure out next how to show the player and CPU choices before showing the modal. Afterwards, I will create the pointing system.

Removed the .hand-container, instead of individual hands (#player-hand, #cpu-hand).

Modified for mobile users.

I had problems with mobile responsiveness.
