## Dev's Reflection
**Finally learned how to format README.md! :)**

Coding this project is difficult, but I had fun writing the game logic! Who knew that coding a game as simple as the **rock, paper, and scissors game** would be this hard! It shows that I am still currently far from being a web developer. But I learn something everyday! I will still study and code to reach being a web developer one day! 

### 01/25/2021 - Inital Commit
Made a working game logic.

### 01/28/2021
Added a simple modal of the winner.

### 01/29/2021
Uploaded a .png versions of the assets to make the program work on Google Chrome.

I added an animation module. I need to figure out next how to show the player and CPU choices before showing the modal. Afterwards, I will create the pointing system.

Removed the `.hand-container`, instead of individual hands (`#player-hand`, `#cpu-hand`).

Modified for mobile users.

I had problems with mobile responsiveness.

### 01/30/2021
Fixed mobile responsiveness bugs.

Showed cpu and player' hands before the winner modal (with `setTimeout`).

Added a simple scoring system.

Shortened the `setTimout` to 800ms.

### 02/02/2021
Rearranged some game logic.

Added colors. Made the UI beatiful.

Cleaned up the code.
